# Sorcero, Inc., a Leader of InsurTech

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company

Sorcero, Inc.

* When was the company incorporated?

Sorcero, Inc. was founded in 2017 and is Headquartered in Washington, D.C.

* Who are the founders of the company?

Sorcerom Inc. was co-founded by Ken Haase, who previously worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Media Lab and Dipanwita Das, who’s previous experience includes time at MindShare Inc.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

The idea that eventually evolved into Sorcero started as health care service. Das wanted to create a that consolidates and digests information and answers questions to save employees time. To quote Das, “the need was clearest when it came to life sciences companies.”

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Das initially invested her own money to get Sorcero to market. The company has around $200,000 in revenue from annual contracts during the pilot stage and expects to incur annual revenues of $500,000. Sorcero’s first funding round of $1.2 million was fully subscribed and it plans to start on a larger seed round of at least $4 million to $5 million by the end of 2019 (this was the latest information I could find related to funding). Sorcero received $3.5 million in funding, July 2020.


## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

Sorcero, Inc. offers an enterprise NLP suite that allows life sciences & insurance industries to handle complex information, policies, rules, and regulations, automates the building of smart knowledge bases and workflows, improving accuracy and redcucing inefficiency. 

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?

Sorcero’s intended customers are insurance companies who utilize their product to access critical information required to mitigate risk. The platform allows companies to develop their own applications that can solve all types of insurance related problems (medical overbilling, high property loss rates, etc.).

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

Sorcero’s Language Intelligence Platform is designed for experts in the most demanding roles, whose high-value tasks need human input. Rather than fully automating workflows, our platform augments expert understanding. Language Intelligence allows domain experts to build off their own knowledge, integrating the information in their head with the understanding contained within the massive amounts of content and documents critical to their work.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

Sorcero utilizes language intelligence, which provides pipelines for the ingestion of content into AI native formats. Sorcero is implementing LI in many ways, one of which is through a partnership with Roche, the world’s largest diagnostic company, to develop a system that tracks ongoing medical guidelines. 

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

Sorcero, Inc. is in the InsurTech industry. Insurtech, a combination of the words “insurance” and “technology”, refers to the use of technology innovations designed to squeeze out savings and efficiency from current insurance industry models.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?

InsurTech companies are trending towards maximizing the application of its data. Over the last few years, data-driven organizations have grown to become 23 times more likely to acquire customers, six times more likely to retain customers, and 19 times more profitable then their contemporaries. Additionally, the domain has shifted towards a focus for compliance, as the domain has been tested by increasing regulatory standards from agencies and other organizations. Lastly, InsurTech companies are increasingly focusing on their mobile applications and capabilities, as a shifting consumer preference for these applications increases. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain?

The other major companies in InsurTech include Lazarus, and their Lazarus AI application, Halos, Zesty and Attestiv.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

Sorcero has been successful to date, having raised $5.4 million in venture capital bridges, outpacing its goal by nearly $2 million, with even more investors willing to back the company. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

One of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure their success is bridge (or startup funding). Using this metric, Sorcero has been greatly successful as it has beat its goal in funding. Another metric is the number of contracted customers they have using their product. Currently, Sorcero has 10 companies in both North America and Europe using their product. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Sorcero has generated lower revenue compared to most of the competitors in its domain but has been disadvantaged by being a recent start-up. Year over year, Sorcero is increasing its revenue and market-share, and I expect will soon become the gold standard of InsurTech.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

As of right now, Sorcero’s service only provides a platform to read and collect data. However, I think Sorcero can greatly increase its product and services by also introducing a system that analyzes and offers recommended business decisions and actions based on its interpretations of the data.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

Offering this product would increase Sorcero’s marketability. There are many competitors within the domain that currently offer a product similar to Sorcero, but if Sorcero could perfect this system of decision-making, many customers would be turned off to their competitor’s products and want to use Sorcero’s for their own business practices. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

This additional product would have to utilize greater human intelligence in order to interpret how the data affects business decision making, and would have to mimic how a real life entrepreneur acts and makes decisions. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

These technologies are appropriate for my solution to ensure that the optimal business decisions are being made for the benefit of our customers.
